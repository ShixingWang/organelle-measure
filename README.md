# Organelle Measurements

## How-to

1. Download the project
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ShixingWang/organelle-measure.git
  cd organelle-measure
  ```
2. Install the package required by the scripts
  ```bash
  mkvirtualenv organelle  # if you want to run the project in an isolated environment 
  pip install -e .
  ```
3. Start your IDE _in the proper directory_

  You can use any IDE you like although I use vscode, but it needs to be started in `organelle-measure/` folder for relative paths to work
  ```bash
  code . & 
  ```
